### Variables and Data Types

I used string to represent "yes" or "no" as decision. It allows the user to select whether they want to enable the regular setings or the colorblind settings.

 !!!Replace with a summary and examples of how multiple variables have been used with a variety of data types and why they have been used effectively and appropriately!!!

### Input and Output

!!!Replace with a summary and examples of how input and output have been used effectively and appropriately!!!
Input is this in this program as the user is asked whether they want to enable colorblind settings and the user inouts either "yes"or "no". Input is seen as cin is this program. 
The output in this program comes after the user inputs their decision. If the user inputs "yes" then the output will say "Colorblind settings enabled." If the user inputs "no" then the output will say "Regular settings enabled." The output in this program is cout.
